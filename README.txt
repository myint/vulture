vulture - Find dead code
========================

vulture finds unused classes, functions and variables in your code. This helps
you cleanup and find errors in your programs. If you run it on both your
library and test suite you can find untested code.

Due to Python's dynamic nature it is impossible to find all dead code for a
static code analyzer like vulture, because it ignores scopes and scans only
token names. Additionally some dynamic items that are not explicitly mentioned
in the code may be incorrectly reported as dead code.


Features
--------

* Fast: Uses static code analysis
* Lightweight: Only one module
* Tested: Comes with a test suite
* Complements *pyflakes* and has the same output syntax


Installation
------------

* vulture supports Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.x

You can install, upgrade, uninstall vulture.py with these commands::

  $ sudo pip install vulture
  $ sudo pip install --upgrade vulture
  $ sudo pip uninstall vulture

`pip` can be installed with `sudo apt-get install python-pip`.


Usage
-----

::

  $ vulture --help


Similar programs
----------------

* vulture can be used together with *pyflakes*
* The *coverage* module can find unused code more reliably, but requires all
  branches of the code to actually be run.


About the name
--------------

A *vulture* eats dead animals. A group of feeding vultures is called a *wake*.
Simples.
